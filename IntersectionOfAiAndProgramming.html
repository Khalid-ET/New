    <h2>How does AI affect Programming</h2>

    <p> With the advancement of AI it benefits and worsens most software-based and employee-based industries. Due to the technological advancement of AI most skilled workers are being replaced by AI counterparts as it’s both easier and sustainable to use AI rather than employees. As AI rapidly grows so does the rate at which people lose their jobs, Such as programming. In programming, AI could replace a front-end developer by showing its efficiency and superiority compared to a human. They could write and debug HTML code faster and more efficiently than a human. Often due to human error codes have slight errors that can substantially affect it but with AI that’s no longer a problem. In conclusion, AI is an efficient substitute for human workers as it’s more beneficial to use AI because of its sustainability and cost reduction. Ethically, it can cause harm to the job market as it puts skilled individuals out of a job.
